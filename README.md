# CustomShaderPack
## A Custom Shader Pack for Rain World
### Adds shaders to change the look of water/other liquids in Rain World

**Current Shaders:**
- Moss Water - Adds an algae like texture to the surface of water (Current version does not have lighting, so it also acts as a bioluminescent version in dark regions. Light affected version planned)

**Planned:**
- Lava Rock - Adds floating rocks to the surface of lava
-
